## Google Data Analyst Certificate - Capstone
## Case Study – How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?


### Introduction 
This is the last part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate that I’ve made in Coursera platform. In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
